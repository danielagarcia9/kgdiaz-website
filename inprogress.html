                <h3>Exploratory analyses for missing data in meta-analyses</h3>
                <h4>Jacob M. Schauer, Karina Diaz, Therese D. Pigott</h4>
                <p>While systematic reviews of substance abuse interventions hold great promise for informing what works for whom and under what 
                    conditions, such reviews must contend with missing data. Missing data can limit the accuracy of statistical analyses or the 
                    relevance of the evidence base and deciding how to handle missing data depends on why it is missing in the first place. In 
                    this tutorial, we examine methods for exploring missingness in a dataset in ways that can help identify the sources and 
                    extent of missingness, as well as clarify gaps in evidence. We demonstrate these methods on a meta-analysis of substance 
                    abuse interventions for adolescents to highlight areas where the evidence less clear and where statistical adjustments 
                    taken by the original authors appear to have been necessary.</p>

                <h3>Adjusting for Covariates with the Standardized Mean Difference Effect Size</h3>
                <h4>Larry V Hedges, Elizabeth Tipton, Karina Diaz, Rrita Zejnullahi</h4>
                <p>Adjusting for baseline characteristics (e.g., pre-tests) is common practice when evaluating the effects of interventions. 
                    While it has been long-known that the use of these adjustments typically leads to an increase in precision of treatment 
                    effect estimates in primary analyses of randomized trials, representing the results of such analyses in the form of effect 
                    sizes, however, has received little attention. In this article, we provide a general framework for defining effect sizes in 
                    designs with a pre-test and propose estimators of those effects sizes. The estimators and their sampling distributions are 
                    evaluated using a simulation study and then demonstrated using an example from published data.</p>

                <h3>A Longitudinal Study of the Gender Gap in Math: Evidence from Chile</h3>
                <h4>Paulina Perez Mejias, Dora Elias McAllister, Karina Diaz Yanez, Javiera Andrea Ravest Tropa</h4>
                <p>Historic achievement gaps in math favoring male students have recently started to narrow or to shift in favor of female students. 
                    Still, in many countries male students tend to outperform their female counterparts in international math assessments. 
                    Chile is one of the countries in which females are farthest behind their male counterparts in math. Using nationally 
                    representative longitudinal data and latent growth modeling, the purpose of this study was to track the scoring gap among 
                    male and female students in math throughout their schooling years. The findings show that gender differences emerge during 
                    pre-school and increasingly widen as students progress through school. Although the gap subsides slightly between Grades 10 
                    and 12, the initial gap almost doubles by the end of high school, with important implications for access to higher education 
                    and choice of major.</p>
