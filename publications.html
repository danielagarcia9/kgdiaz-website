                    <h3>Implementing Government Elementary Math Exercises Online: Positive Effects Found in RCT under Social Turmoil in Chile</h3>
                    <h4>Roberto Araya and <b style="color:#ED7D3A;">Karina Diaz</b></h4>
                    <p>The impact of online math programs depends on its implementation, especially in vulnerable populations from developing 
                        countries. An existing online platform was adapted, at the request of the Chilean Ministry of Education, to exclusively 
                        include exercises previously designed and tested by a paper-based government program for elementary school. We carried out 
                        a cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 50 fourth grade classrooms. Treatment classrooms used the platform in a 
                        weekly 90-min math session. Due to a social instability outbreak in the country, a large unexpected disruption with huge 
                        absenteeism occurred in the second half of the semester, which turned this study into a unique opportunity to explore the 
                        robustness of the platform’s effects on students’ learning. Using multiple imputation and multilevel models, we found a 
                        statistically significant effect size of 0.13, which corresponds to two extra months of learning. This effect is meaningful 
                        for four reasons. First, it has double the effect of the paper-based version. Second, it was achieved during one semester 
                        only. Third, is half that obtained with the platform for a complete year with its own set of exercises and with two sessions 
                        per week instead of one. Fourth, it was attained in a semester with a lot of absenteeism.

                    <h3>Gender Gap in University Admission Test in Chile: What is Happening at the Top and Bottom of the Test Score Distribution?</h3>
                    <h4><b style="color:#ED7D3A;">Karina Gabriela Diaz Yanez</b>, Javiera Andrea Ravest Tropa, Juan Pablo Queupil Quilamán</h4>
                    <p>Transition to tertiary education is a key step for students, which usually involves the application of admission tests. 
                        In general, when contrasting different groups of people —mainly based on socio-economic variables—, analyzes of this type of 
                        evidence are mostly concentrated on averages test scores, where few studies incorporate a gender perspective. In this sense, 
                        this study focuses on the Chilean context, and concentrates the analysis in the upper tail of the scores —where the actual 
                        university admission is occurring—, and lower —where potential lack of learning opportunities is exposed— of the University 
                        Selection Test (PSU). At the same time, gender gaps are compared for the 2014-2018 period in the mentioned top and bottom 
                        zones of the distribution of test scores. Results indicate that there are persistent gaps that limit the possibilities for 
                        women to pursue university careers in areas related to science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Therefore, it is 
                        important that both public and university policies consider affirmative and complementary actions that may address these 
                        issues, considering the ongoing higher education reform and possible changes into the Chilean university admission system.
